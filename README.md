<h1>La Rosa Restaurant</h1>

<p>
  Lightweight, responsive, smooth frontend website for a local restaurant.  The goal was to create user friendly design combining text
  and images with animations for an overall pleasing user experience while company products have a chance to shine.
  <br>
  The design is built with simple HTML5, and CSS3 including the fading and sliding animations.  Javascipt is used for the purpose of
  triggering animations when element is revealed on scroll.
  <br>Bundled with Webpack
